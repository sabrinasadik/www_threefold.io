## Technology

![Zero OS](/threefoldtoken/static/img/favicon.png)

[Zero OS](https://github.com/zero-os)

A light weight operating system that runs on a wide variety of hardware components. It is open source, build on proven technology and requires very little knowledge and understanding to install and operate. It cannot be tampered and interacted with as it only accepts instructions from the Zero Robot.

[Zero Robot](https://github.com/zero-os/0-robot/tree/master)

A general purpose bot that can be 'trained' to perform millions of different tasks.  Similar to human beings that can develop themselves into artists, scientists or doctors by the Zero Robot 'lives' on the Zero OS operating system and can be trained to perform tasks on Zero OS, system administration tasks, data processing tasks, data storage tasks etc.  The Zero Robot accepts tasks that are agreed and stored on the Zero Chain.

[Zero Chain](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/tfchain)

A proof of (block) stake blockchain that is very efficient and specifically tailored for different tasks.  It provides a generic framework to achieve more functionality than for example single purpose financial blockchains and is a lot simpler and therefore scalable than general purpose (smart contract) blockchains.  It runs as multiple single purpose instances and provides all transaction means to operate a distributed responsible internet on Zero OS.

#Technology Trinity, ThreeFold

#### Distributed Responsible Internet Technology

A Distributed Responsible Internet creates **freedom**, **equality** and **fairness**.  For this we need technology that is available to everyone while respecting individual privacy, neutrality, data security and protects individual freedom and equality.

This technology has to be **simple** and **self sustaining**. It needs to enable anyone to become a part of this responsible internet without being a technologist.  It has to work everywhere, also in places where it is impossible to have people maintaining systems.

This technology has to be **accessible**. Many available technologies are commercially available at price levels where only some of us can afford them.  A true distributed responsible internet,  for everyone, has to be without any financial requirements.

This technology has to incorporate an **immutable** record for everything.  If it is for everyone to create and consume, if it has to operate in a self sustaining manner where it can do without human intervention we have to have immutable record for financial and operational transation logging.

#### The solution: a trinity of technology components

This distributed, self sustaining responsible internet requires three components that are tightly linked.  **Zero OS** as the operating system, **Zero Robot** being the trained operator for operational and financial tasks and  **Zero Chain** the immutable record of financial and operational transactions.
