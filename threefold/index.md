<!-- Intro Section -->
# ThreeFold Foundation

Internet compute and storage capacity democratized. Open source software that creates neutral, green and private capacity by people for people. 100% decentralized.

# Democratized Internet, what does that mean?

#### Freedom

The current internet is controlled by large corporations that see internet users as a product, sheeple. The new internet should be responsible and democratized, protecting individual privacy, neutrality, and security.

#### Equality

The internet should be inclusive to all of humanity. We are building a collectively owned internet that's deployed everywhere and accessible to all, not just in datacenters or high-income countries.

#### Fairness

The internet is currently run by a handful of large companies who benefit financially from our data - everyone should be able to enjoy a return for participating and sharing internet capacity while maintaining our data privacy.

<!-- Components Section -->
# What components do we need to realize this democratized internet?

#### IT Infrastructure

A grid of independently owned compute and storage nodes

#### Currency

Digital decentralized currency (Tokens) to free the system from restrictions of the existing (digital) currency systems

#### Management

System Management bots manage the grid without human intervention

#### Security

Our own blockchain secures the bots to make sure that they can safely work together

<!-- Technologies Section -->

## What technologies have we created to do this?

![TF Solution](/threefoldtoken/static/img/img-20-solution.png)

#### Zero-OS

A simple and efficient operating system to build this democratized grid of capacity, easy to install, easy to maintain and always available: Zero-OS.  This operating system is available to anyone that wants to build a part of this democratized internet at zero costs: it is open source.

#### Zero-Robot

They manage the Zero-OS Grid to deliver a self healing responsible internet.

#### Zero-Chain

Our own blockchain technology can be used to create any responsible digital currency (green, faster, cost effective, scalable).  We use it to create consensus for our Zero-Robots.
