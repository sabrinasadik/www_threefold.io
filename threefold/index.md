# ThreeFold Foundation

We believe in a world in which technology supports each of us, as well as the planet that sustains us.

We dream of a world of empowered people connecting the dots and co-creating the internet and the economy of the future.

To keep up with ever-increasing demand, to save our collective resources, and to make both access to the internet and participation in the global economy more inclusive for people world-wide, **we need next level technologies for the new world.**

ThreeFold’s open source technology enables the creation of **an internet by everyone for everyone.**

# vision

Data will be the gold of the new digital economy.

The need for data is growing exponentially due to increasing internet use, self-driving cars and the Internet of Things.

The existing global economic model is reaching its limits, excluding many and diminishing finite resources.

To achieve our dream of a more empowered global community, resource-saving technology and a more inclusive economy, our vision is to:

We wanted to do all this as a transparent collective, a responsible digital organization which reflects our core values- so we started the Threefold Foundation.

Together we are making our dream of a neutral, green distributed internet a reality.

# why?

The internet today is heavily centralized, owned and controlled by a few large corporations who control 80% of internet infrastructure and storage capacity. This results in inequalities in unequal distribution and issues with speed and connectivity.

The need for internet capacity is growing exponentially, both the number of users around the globe and the sheer volume of connected devices. The current architecture of hyperscale data centers is not able to cope with this demand.

## The need for capacity is constantly growing. In 10 years the world will use 15 times more internet capacity.

## Today most storage and compute capacity is generated by hyperscale data centers.

![TF DataCenter](/threefoldtoken/static/img/img-07-datacenters.png)

Data centers are built only in energy dense areas because they consume huge amounts of energy.

## The internet today is highly centralized.

## Centralized internet is inefficient, expensive and wasteful.

#### Consider electricity:

If consumers in Turkey had to use electricity generated in the USA, it would be expensive and inefficient, because it is generated at too remote a distance.. Transmission lines would be strained, and losses and repairs would make it unsustainable. There would be multiple areas without access to electricity.

This is exactly what is happening with the internet today.

Some of the major technical problems with the internet are:

![Latency](/threefoldtoken/static/img/img-08-latency.png)

###### Latency

![Bandwith](/threefoldtoken/static/img/img-09-bandwidth.png)

###### Bandwith

![Autonomy](/threefoldtoken/static/img/img-10-autonomy.png)

###### Autonomy

![Privacy and Security](/threefoldtoken/static/img/img-10-privacy.png)

###### Privacy and Security

Threefold believes the solution to this trillion dollar problem is the migration of internet infrastructure to the “Edge”, close to the users.

# how?

Our technology enables a maximally distributed grid of data and compute capacity, generated by many small nodes owned by individual farmers.

## ThreeFold’s disruptive technology

![TF Solution](/threefoldtoken/static/img/img-20-solution.png)

#### Self healing cloud

To gain efficiency in IT infrastructure and services, we are applying a new paradigm- eradicating the human element in IT management- to architecting, provisioning, deployment and operation of IT infrastructures.

#### Best utilization of hardware

An operating system that erases multiple layers and delivers compute and storage capacity everywhere, much closer to the hardware, making it cost efficient and energy saving.

## And, ThreeFold internet is better for the planet, because it consumes a fraction of electricity that traditional data centers do.
