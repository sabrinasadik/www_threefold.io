<!-- Earn Tokens -->

## The Two Ways Farmers can earn ThreeFold Tokens

### Farming

Farmers earn TFTs for connecting their capacity to the TF grid

TFTs awarded for connecting a farm are calculated at the time the capacity is assigned to the TF Grid. The farmer receives 1/60th of these tokens for a maximum of 60 months.

Amount of TFTs awarded is based on the monthly capacity revenue value in USD, and the price of the TFT at the time the capacity is assigned to the grid.

### Cultivating

Farmers earn TFTs when capacity is sold

Capacity is sold via the ThreeFold Directory, a blockchain based capacity listing system.

### ThreeFold Directory

Fully decentralized.

All capacity listed so users can choose their farm or location.

Tokens come directly to the Farmer.

ThreeFold Foundation charges 10% of these tokens as a revenue sharing for IT development and marketing.
