#### TF Grid expansion through capacity farming
The ThreeFold Grid is build by people for people. It is made of independently owned hardware running the Zero-OS operating system. This operating system is a minimal operating system that makes hardware components available to anyone as a utility. This utility is available to anyone who wants to compute and store data.

Grid expansion is driven by individuals with an interest to earn ThreeFold Tokens. Newly created grid capacity translates directly to a token return based on the quatity of utility being created by the hardware provided.

#### TF Grid utilisation through use cases
We are all consuming more and more compute and storage for everyday life. Independent studies show that that expansion is exponential. To deliver this ever expanding need for compute and storage capacity the Threefold grid is going local. Local capacity enables local entrepreneurs to develop capacity use cases for local communities. No need to use remote, centrally owned, inefficient datacenters.
