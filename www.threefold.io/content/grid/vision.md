#### Expansion of the ThreeFOld Grid by Capacity Farming
The ThreeFold Grid is built by people and for people. It consists of independently owned hardware running the Zero OS operating system. Zero OS is a minimal operating system that makes hardware components available to anyone as a utility. This utility capacity is available to anyone who wants to use compute power or to store data.

ThreeFold Grid expansion is driven by individuals and organisations, known as ThreeFold Farmers, who earn ThreeFold Tokens by providing capacity on the TF Grid. Newly created TF Grid capacity generates a token return directly based on the quantity and quality of utility created by the hardware connected by the Farmer.

#### Use case utilization of the ThreeFold Grid
Independent studies show that the consumption of compute and storage in our everyday life is undergoing exponential growth. To deliver on this ever-expanding demand, we need to deliver more capacity in the locality it is needed.

The ThreeFold Grid solves this problem be allowing internet capacity to be delivered where it is needed. Essentially, the ThreeFold Grid allows the internet to go local.

Local capacity enables local entrepreneurs to develop capacity use cases for local communities. No need to use remote, centrally owned and inefficient datacenters. The capacity can be delivered where it is needed, at much lower cost.
