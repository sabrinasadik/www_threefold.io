#### Utility use cases

The grid presents ever increasing utility for people to create use cases for.  Use cases can be very traditional like existing use cases for web content, e-commerce sites, photo storage and music streaming.  This created utility can fuel any online activity, current and future!

#### Storage and Archive
We all create and therefore store more information daily.  Independent research firms predict that this growth is exponential.  Therefore we require more storage and archiving capacity.  The grid utility can be used to create storage and archiving solutions.  Combining

#### Distributed always on applications
The future is distributed.  Applications will no longer exist in centralized private or public datacenters.  Applications are getting smaller and single purpose. These applications can live on minimal utility, everywhere

#### Internet of things
Internet of things means that all devices will have a smart components, connected to the internet.  This creates an environment where applications can run everywhere, data is collected and can be processed everywhere.  In this world ubiquitous utility for compute and storage is as mandatory as the necessity of electricity everywhere today to power al of our mobile devices around us.
