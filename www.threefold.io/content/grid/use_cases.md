# Utility use cases
value_img = "/svg/ic-gridcase.svg"
value_header = "Utility use cases"
value_content = "TF Grid technology is ideal for traditional utility use cases such as web content, e-commerce sites, photo storage and music streaming. It allows a more economic, secure and robust delivery of capacity for any current and future online activity."

# Storage and Archive
good_img = "/svg/ic-storecase.svg"
good_header = "Storage and Archive"
good_content = "Independent studies show that each day the growth of information that we create and store is increaing exponentially.  In a nutshell, we simply require more storage and archiving capacity than we can currently provide. TF Grid technology can be used to create storage and archiving solutions at almost infinite scale, and at a fraction of the cost."

# Distributed always on applications
vBacked_img = "/svg/ic-distributed1.svg"
vBacked_header = "Distributed always on applications"
vBacked_content = "The future is distributed. Applications will no longer exist in centralized private or public datacenters. Applications are getting smaller and more specialized to fulfil a single purpose. These applications need to live on minimal utility. The TF Grid is designed to allow distributed applications to exist anywhere."

# Internet of things
reliable_img = "/svg/ic-iot.svg"
reliable_header = "Internet of things"
reliable_content = "The Internet of things means that all devices will have smart components and be connected to the internet. This creates an environment where applications can run everywhere and data is collected and can be processed from anywhere. In this world, ubiquitous utility for local compute and storage is as necessary as the electricity we expect to be available to power our mobile devices, homes and businesses."
