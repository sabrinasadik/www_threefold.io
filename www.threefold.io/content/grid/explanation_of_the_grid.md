## What is the ThreeFold Grid.

## Grid expansion

The ThreeFold Grid is build by people for people.  It is made of independently owned hardware running the Zero-OS operating system.  This operating system is a minimal operating system that has one single task to make all hardware components available to anyone as a utility.  This utility is available to anyone who wants to compute and store data.

Grid expansion is driven by individuals with an interest to earn ThreeFold Tokens.  Newly created grid capacity translates directlyuto token returns based on how much utility is being created by the hardware provided.

## Grid utilisation

We are all consuming more and more compute and storage for everyday life.  To deliver this ever expanding need for compute and storage capacity the Threefold grid is going local.  Local capacity enables local entrepreneurs to develop capacity use cases for local communities. No need to use remote, centrally owned, inefficient datacenters

Grid utilisation comes from businesses and people supporting local capacity that also want to be in control of their data.
