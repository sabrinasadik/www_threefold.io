The ThreeFold Grid is build by anyone for everyone.  It is made of independently owned hardware running the Zero-OS operating system.  This operating system is a minimal operating system that has one single task to make all hardware components available to anyone as a utility.  This utility is available to anyone who wants to compute and store data.

Grid expansion is driven by individuals with an interest to earn ThreeFold Tokens.  Newly created grid capacity translates directlyuto token returns based on how much utility is being created by the hardware provided.
