##### The internet is growing like crazy. This is a Trillion Dollar problem. Together we can build a new internet.

## The Problem
* The internet is no longer the neutral place it used to be. 80+% of internet capacity is delivered by a handful of companies. This results in loss of neutrality and openness and breeds inequality.
* To support the continuous growth of the internet and connect billions of new Internet Of Things devices, 400 million new servers are needed by 2020. The world needs another 4,000 large - scale datacenters that each consume 200 MWs of electricity: source  http://bit.ly/1UPUZYG.
* Bandwidth does not follow Moore’s law. The growth of bandwidth required is much higher than the speed at which new capacity can be delivered.This is even more important in emerging markets.
* Today, 3.2 billion people have no access to internet due to the high costs of connectivity and capacity. We believe these people have the fundamental right to have low-cost access to digital resources like online education, health information, social media and online communities … Solutions which can lower the cost by a factor of 10 are required.
* Current blockchain technology is not scalable and not green. Example: the Bitcoin blockchain alone uses more energy today than Croatia.

## Internet Capacity Today = The Cloud
Today cloud computing is a $100+ billion industry – mostly owned by 20 or so global cooperations. Experts such as Bell Labs and Cisco believe the capacity requirement in the next decade will dramatically outstrip existing infrastructure – requiring an additional 400m servers – or approximately 4000 hyperscale datacenters – at a cost of $250m to $1b each.

The spectacular growth and advances of cloud computing that have occurred over the last decade resulted in large part from "hyperscale" efficiencies – i.e. centralizing internet infrastructure in very large billion dollar datacenters. Today, demand for internet capacity is already outstripping the available infrastructure as new applications like Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT) and Self Healing technology come online at scale. The existing hyperscale datacenter approach cannot cope with this outsize demand as the requirements for land, power and funding are just too great.

The challenges facing the internet include the following:

* Trillions of dollars of investment required. In the next decade, the global internet infrastructure requires another 4,000 datacenters (250M$ – $1bn+ each) to meet demand which would cost trillions – an impossible amount of money.
* It is impossible to scale the network connecting users to the hyperscale datacenters. Since Hyperscale datacenters are built in large central locations, the network leading to these datacenters is congested. Even more, remote regions that are less connected to the internet cannot benefit from the datacenters’ IT services.
* Non-local data and capacity. Governments around the world are becoming more and more concerned about data leaving their borders – these governments require IT infrastructure to be local. Furthermore, IoT workloads require local capacity to deliver constant real-time computing and storage requirements – for certain applications and workloads (e.g. driverless cars), latency is not an option. Hyperscale Datacenters can simply not deliver to these requirements.
* Non-secure, risk of choke-point failures. There are plenty of recent well-publicized problems with security, outages and lost data. The reason for these issues is that centralised hyperscale architectures are inherently insecure – and failures at a single hyperscale location can cause widespread contagion and outages.

## The ThreeFold Solution
Our solution to these trillion dollar problems is to migrate internet IT capacity to the Edge – i.e. a “hyperdistributed” network architecture, located close to users - in cities, schools, offices, homes and even vehicles.

Edge networks will not necessarily replace the existing hyperscale capacity powering today’s cloud – rather, Edge networks will scale to meet the increased capacity demand going forward.

By 2025, 60% of new internet infrastructure will be decentralized and located at the edge of the operator networks, using alternative locations which have stable (renewable) power, and reliable connectivity.

The ThreeFold solution has the following main benefits:

### SECURE
* The Grid is distributed and benefits from our identity and authentication management platform – making it much more secure

### GREEN
* The technology avoids having to build huge power hungry datacenters (we are 10x more green)
* The solution brings capacity where the consumers are = Cloud At The Edge
* We make IT a true utility = IT As Energy (3x more uptime, 3 - 10x more cost effective)

### NEUTRAL
* The solution enables 100% neutral & private internet IT capacity.
* Our blockchain technology provides security, neutrality & scale.

## ThreeFold Nodes
We use a special box called the ThreeFold Zero-Node. The Zero-Node provides blockchain hosting for the network. 

Additionally, we have ThreeFold Node Servers which provide compute & storage capacity to the internet. This capacity can be used for any possible workload.

The nodes are modular – scaling from 1 vCPUs and 0.25 TB of storage (smallest) to clusters with 8000 vCPUs and 2 petabytes of storage (large).

### THREEFOLD NODES ARE GREEN
* For storage the boxes use about 10 times less energy, for other workloads typically about 2 to 3 times less energy.

### THREEFOLD NODES ARE AT THE EDGE AND SAVE NETWORK TRAFFIC.
Our Zero Operating System ("Zero OS") is ideally suited for Edge networking – where automation, self-healing and hyperdistribution are must-haves.
– Nodes are deployed as close as possible to the consumers of internet IT capacity (IoT, residential, business, government, education, etc.) This results in massive bandwidth savings, we estimate to be able to keep 99% of the required bandwidth local - which has huge impact on cost. This is the only viable solution to be able to provide internet to the 3.2 billion people waiting for a more equitable and economical solution to their connection and communication needs.

### THE NODES ARE SELF HEALING & COST EFFECTIVE
* Zero OS ensure that the network is self-healing and always available & reliable

### THE NODES ARE NEUTRAL, PRIVATE AND EASY TO USE
* A lot of work has been done on using the blockchain (technology which powers our digital currency) to guarantee privacy and net neutrality
* Easy to use by everyone
* No need for complex integration services to deliver complex IT applications
* Usable by the "other billions" beacuse of the low cost-point, low energy requirement and reduced need of backbone network capacity
