chain_content = "A proof of (block) stake blockchain that is very efficient and specifically tailored for different tasks.  It provides a generic framework to achieve more functionality than for example single purpose financial blockchains and is a lot simpler and therefore scalable than general purpose (smart contract) blockchains.  It runs as multiple single purpose instances and provides all transaction means to operate a distribited reponsible internet on Zero OS."
