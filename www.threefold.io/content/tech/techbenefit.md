#### Responsible Internet Technology 

The Responsible Internet creates FREEDOM, EUALITY and FAIRNESS.  To achieve this we have to have acces to technology that allows for ownership of it for everyone, respecting individual privacy, neutrality and data security, protecting individual freedom and equality by not requiring specific technical knowledge.

The technology delivering this has to follow a number of simpel rules.  
- **Simplicity**: for everyone without any knowledge requirements
- **Accessability**: for everyone without any financial requirements
- **Immutability**: for everyone without anyone taking advantage

Building technology that complies with all these rules requires a fundamental different approach that what has been done to date.

#### Technology Trinity

The trinity of this Responsible Internet are **Zero OS**, **Zero Robot**, **Zero Chain**.

The **Zero OS** is a light operating system that runs on a wide variety of hardware components. It is open source, build on proven technology and requires very little knowledge and understanding to install and operate.  It cannot be tampered and interacted with as it only accepts instructions from the **Zero Robot**

**Zero Robot** is a general purpose Bot that can be "trained" to perform hundreds of different tasks.  Similar to human beings that can develop themselve to become artists, scientists or doctors by acquiring knowledge on specific topic the **Zero Robot** "lives" on the **Zero OS** operating system and can be trained to perform tasks on **Zero OS**, system administration tasks, data processing tasks, data storage tasks etc.  The **Zero Robot** accepts tasks that are agreed and stored on the **Zero Chain**

The **Zero Chain** is a proof of (block) stake blockchain that is very efficient and tailored to different tasks.  It provides a generic framework to achieve more functionality than single purpose financial blockchains and is a lot simpler and easier to maintain than general purpose smart contract blockchains.  It runs on **Zero OS** in multiple single purpose instances and provides transaction means for people to transact financially and perform all task related to **Zero OS** and **Zero Robot**.
