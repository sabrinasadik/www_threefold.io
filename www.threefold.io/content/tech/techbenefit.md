#### Responsible Internet Technology 

The Responsible Internet creates FREEDOM, EUALITY and FAIRNESS.  To achieve this we have to have acces to technology that allows for ownership of it for everyone, respecting individual privacy, neutrality and data security, protecting individual freedom and equality by not requiring specific technical knowledge.

The technology delivering this has to follow a number of simpel rules.  
- Simplicity: for everyone without any knowledge requirements
- Accessability: for everyone without any financial requirements
- Immutability: for everyone without anyone taking advantage

Building technology that complieas with all these rules requires a fundamental different  approach that what has been done to date.

#### Required components

The trinity of this Responsible Internet are Zero OS, Zero Robot, Zero Chain.
