#### Distributed Responsible Internet Technology

A Distributed Responsible Internet creates **freedom**, **equality** and **fairness**. For this, we need technology that is available to everyone while respecting individual privacy, neutrality, data security and protects individual freedom and equality.

This technology has to be **simple** and **self-sustaining**. It needs to enable anyone to become a part of this responsible internet without being a technologist. It has to work everywhere, also in places where it is impossible to have people maintaining systems.

This technology has to be **accessible**. Many available technologies are available at price levels where only some of us can afford them. A true distributed responsible internet, for everyone, has to be without any financial requirements.

This technology has to incorporate an **immutable** record for everything. If it is for everyone to create and consume if it has to operate in a self-sustaining manner where it can do without human intervention we have to have an immutable record for financial and operational transaction logging.

#### THE SOLUTION: A TRINITY OF TECHNOLOGY COMPONENTS

This distributed, self-sustaining responsible internet requires three components linked together. **Zero OS** as the operating system, **Zero Robot** being the trained operator for operational and financial tasks, and **Zero Chain** the immutable record of financial and operational transactions.
