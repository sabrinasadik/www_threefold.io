#### Distributed Responsible Internet Technology 

The Distributed Responsible Internet creates FREEDOM, EQUALITY and FAIRNESS.  For this we need technology for everyone, respecting individual privacy, neutrality and data security, protecting individual freedom and equality without needing specific technical knowledge.

The technology has to follow a number of simpel rules.  
- It needs to be **simple**: for everyone without any knowledge requirements
- It needs to the **accesiible**: for everyone without any financial requirements
- It needs to be **immutable**: for everyone without anyone taking advantage

Creating technology complying these rules requires a fundamental different approach.  You have to start from a blank sheet of paper.

#### Technology Trinity

The trinity of this Responsible Internet technology are **Zero OS**, **Zero Robot** and **Zero Chain**.

The **Zero OS** is a light weight operating system that runs on a wide variety of hardware components. It is open source, build on proven technology and requires very little knowledge and understanding to install and operate.  It cannot be tampered and interacted with as it only accepts instructions from the **Zero Robot**

**Zero Robot** is a general purpose Bot that can be "trained" to perform millions of different tasks.  Similar to human beings that can develop themselves into artists, scientists or doctors by the **Zero Robot** "lives" on the **Zero OS** operating system and can be trained to perform tasks on **Zero OS**, system administration tasks, data processing tasks, data storage tasks etc.  The **Zero Robot** accepts tasks that are agreed and stored on the **Zero Chain**

The **Zero Chain** is a proof of (block) stake blockchain that is very efficient and specifically tailored for different tasks.  It provides a generic framework to achieve more functionality than for example single purpose financial blockchains and is a lot simpler and therefore scalable than general purpose (smart contract) blockchains.  It runs on **Zero OS** in multiple single purpose instances and provides all transaction means to operate a distribited reponsible internet **Zero OS** and **Zero Robot**.
