#### Responsible Internet Technology 

The Responsible Internet creates FREEDOM, EUALITY and FAIRNESS.  To achieve this we have to have technology that allows for:
- ownership needs to be for everyone, respecting individual privacy, neutrality and data security, protecting individual freedom.
- equality by not requiring specific technical knowledge to be as inclusive as possible.

The technology delivering this has to follow a number of simpel rules.  
- Simplicity: for everyone without any knowledge requirements
- Accessability: for everyone without any financial requirements
- Immutability: for everyone without anyone taking advantage

Building technology that complieas with all these rules requires a fundamental different  approach that what has been done to date.

#### Required components

The trinity of this Responsible Internet are Zero OS, Zero Robot, Zero Chain.
