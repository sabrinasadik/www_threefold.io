#### Distributed Responsible Internet Technology

A Distributed Responsible Internet creates **freedon**, **equality** and **fairness**.  For this we need technology that is available to everyone while respecting individual privacy, neutrality and data security and protects individual freedom and equality.

This technology meets basic rules.  
- **simple**: for everyone without any knowledge requirements
- **accessible**: for everyone without any financial requirements
- **immutable**: for everyone excluding others taking advantage

#### The solution: a trinity of technology components

**Zero OS**.  A light weight operating system that runs on a wide variety of hardware components. It is open source, build on proven technology and requires very little knowledge and understanding to install and operate.  It cannot be tampered and interacted with as it only accepts instructions from the **Zero Robot**.

**Zero Robot**. A general purpose Bot that can be "trained" to perform millions of different tasks.  Similar to human beings that can develop themselves into artists, scientists or doctors by the Zero Robot "lives" on the Zero OS operating system and can be trained to perform tasks on Zero OS, system administration tasks, data processing tasks, data storage tasks etc.  The Zero Robot accepts tasks that are agreed and stored on the **Zero Chain**.

**Zero Chain**. A proof of (block) stake blockchain that is very efficient and specifically tailored for different tasks.  It provides a generic framework to achieve more functionality than for example single purpose financial blockchains and is a lot simpler and therefore scalable than general purpose (smart contract) blockchains.  It runs as multiple single purpose instances and provides all transaction means to operate a distribited reponsible internet on **Zero OS**.

 ... **Zero OS** ... **Zero Robot** ... **Zero Chain** ... a trinity of responsible Internet technology
