*Freedom*

The current internet is controlled by large corporations that see internet users as a product, sheeple. The new internet should be responsible and democratized, protecting individual privacy, neutrality, and security.

*Equality*

The current internet is not inclusive to all of humanity. We are building a collectively owned internet that's deployed everywhere and accessible to all, not just in datacenters or high-income countries.

*Fairness*

The current internet is run by a small number of large companies who enjoy all the returns - this is not right - everyone should be able to enjoy a return for participating and creating internet capacity.
