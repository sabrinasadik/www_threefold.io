#### Freedom

The current internet is controlled by large corporations that see internet users as a product, sheeple. The new internet should be responsible and democratized, protecting individual privacy, neutrality, and security.

#### Equality

The internet should be inclusive to all of humanity. We are building a collectively owned internet that's deployed everywhere and accessible to all, not just in datacenters or high-income countries.

#### Fairness

The internet is currently run by a handful of large companies who benefit financially from our data - everyone should be able to enjoy a return for participating and sharing internet capacity while maintaining our data privacy.
