Data will be the gold of the new digital economy.



#### Freedom

To achieve our dream of a more empowered global community, resource-saving technology and a more inclusive economy, our vision is to:

#### Equality

The internet should be inclusive to all of humanity. We are building a collectively owned internet that's deployed everywhere and accessible to all, not just in datacenters or high-income countries.

#### Fairness

The internet is currently run by a handful of large companies who benefit financially from our data - everyone should be able to enjoy a return for participating and sharing internet capacity while maintaining our data privacy.
