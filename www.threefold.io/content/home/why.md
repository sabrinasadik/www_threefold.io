The internet today is heavily centralized, owned and controlled by a few large corporations who control 80% of internet infrastructure and storage capacity. As a consequence, there is substantial inequality at a global scale. There is unequal distribution of infrastructure and storage capacity as well as issues of unequal distribution of speed and connectivity.

The need for internet capacity is growing exponentially, both the number of users around the globe and the sheer volume of connected devices. The current architecture of hyperscale datacenters is not able to cope with this demand.
