The internet today is heavily centralized, owned and controlled by a few large corporations who control 80% of internet infrastructure and storage capacity. As a consequence, there is substantial inequality at a global scale. There is unequal distribution of infrastructure and storage capacity as well as issues of unequal distribution of speed and connectivity.


#### IT Infrastructure

A grid of independently owned compute and storage nodes

#### Currency

Digital decentralized currency (Tokens) to free the system from restrictions of the existing (digital) currency systems

#### Management

System Management bots manage the grid without human intervention

#### Security

Our own blockchain secures the bots to make sure that they can safely work together
