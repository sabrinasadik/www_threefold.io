##### Our magic box providing internet capacity.

The guiding design principle is that simpler solutions increase efficiency and productivity “Less = More”

The Zero-OS (Stateless Operating System) node technology is based on technology that has been developed and innovated upon for 15 years in an incubation center. Mid to late 90s some of us were working for a large American firm that was investing in creating Europe’s first large scale (internet) datacenters and internet connectivity. In that period 5 major datacenters were built and put into production. We became frustrated with the amount of money, time and energy required to architect, install, operate and maintain complex IT infrastructures. This led to a passionate and energetic period in which better technology was created to address these issues.

To build a technology stack from point solutions from "brand" vendors requires a tremendous amount of integration software, equipment, knowledge and human resource effort. The result is a very complicated operational setup that costs too much money, uses a lot of power and requires a large amount of maintenance contracts and engineers.

This inspired us to create a more effective IT architecture powering IT workloads without all the complexity and unnecessary components. We did this by starting an incubation center to specifically develop technologies creating more efficient ways of doing very standard things:

* Use more of the available compute power for virtualisation technologies to allow multiple tenants to use one physical machine.
* Create a performant and reliable storage solution by using standard off-the-shelf components and stay as far away as possible from proprietary hardware and software to enhance storage performance.
* Create a low-level power management device that is able to manage and monitor the whole upstream power feed and create efficient power consumption. One of the key aspects of this technology is that it measures Voltage and Amperage 25k times a second, to provide very detailed information about how the power supply is "consuming" the power and allows for analytical failure prediction.

A Zero Node consists of hardware and software. A Zero Node can be purchased from the ThreeFold Foundation or by downloading and installing software on existing re-purposed hardware.
