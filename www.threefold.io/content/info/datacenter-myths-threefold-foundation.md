Hyperscale realities

### MYTH 1: BIG DATACENTERS ARE MORE EFFICIENT THAN SMALL ONES.

There are advantages in building large scale datacenters such as economies of scale and sheer bulk-buying power - but these are not as big as people think. The average cost per rack in a hyperscale datacenter is 20-35K USD including all energy and safety systems. The cost of the hardware per rack is around between 200k and 300k.

What is often forgotten, is that anything that is of enormous scale, and therefore highly concentrated, is also highly complex and creates a specific set of problems to deal with. Think of resource requirements like investment, operational costs, knowledge and people.

In reality keeping things simple and small is much more cost effective than a big complex environment.

### MYTH 2: BIG DATACENTERS CAN BE MADE GREEN.

The carbon footprint of a big datacenter is enormous. To improve the PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) most datacenter farmers have adopted wind, hydro and/or solar power technologies, which indeed does help drop their PUE by an estimated 20%.

While this 20% looks great on paper and in the company's corporate social responsibility report. It is mostly just an improvement on the cooling technology, not the actual energy power _consumed_ by the equipment that runs in their datacenter (servers, storage chassises, physical disks, etc.) To get the full 100% of the carbon footprint, this equipment must be included as well as the full overhead power consumption to cool the facility, open and close the doors, the power security systems, etc.

So the real improvement lies in deploying technologies that actually consume _less power_ to deliver the _actual Internet IT capacity_ that runs the workloads, the CPUs, each chassis, the physical disks and the storage cabinets. Working on how hardware is being more effectively used can have an impact of 1000% and lead to 10 times more power efficiency.

### MYTH 3: REDUNDANT SYSTEMS HAVE A BETTER UPTIME?

This is how a lot of us have been raised. Systems need redundancy mechanisms to improve their operational uptime and reliability. And to be honest if you look at it (through IT-tainted glasses) for a minute this seems to make a lot of sense… But what if we translate this to the non IT World?

To make a car more reliable we add redundancy (as we do in IT). So for the risk of having a puncture we add one extra tire for all the tires we use continuously. This adds 4 extra tires to the car. Then a decision needs to be made: Do we put those tires in a structure where they are always running along the primary tires or do we chose not to have them "on line" all the time, so they are subject to the same wear and tear as the primary tires? This is what happens with some IT hot swap systems.

To build such a system would change cars as we know them, and it would take a large number of engineers to come up with a solution. And while they work to come up with the solution, would it not make more sense to think outside the box? Why don't we just solve the root of the problem by making tires undeflatable?

The IT industry has gone overboard with the concept of redundancy, it forgot somehow to look at the root causes which helped spawn a whole new industry. One that, obviously, wants to keep itself in the business of creating complicated and expensive redundant systems…

### MYTH 4: BIG COMPANIES KNOW BETTER HOW TO OPTIMIZE.

"Big companies with a track record know better how to optimize, they have more people…"

At first sight this also sounds logical, but if we look at the IT landscape today, 90%+ of innovation in IT is done by small startups… The big legacy IT companies have a huge heritage they find difficult to escape. They are locked in old infrastructure designs and, after a while, the build out of the infrastructure becomes the brake for their business. Real innovation dies a slows death and in comes the painkiller approach.
